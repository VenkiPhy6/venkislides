<li><em>Construct</em>: In-person schooling mode ensures higher student performance.</li>

<h2 id="c-what-is-the-sample-does-the-sample-represent-the-population">c) What is the sample? Does the sample represent the population?</h2>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Under-Coverage: Data is only available from 11 states.</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="but-fat-thor-is-good-enough">But fat Thor is good enough!</h2>
<ul>
<li>We can accommodate just having 11 states of data.</li>
<li>We can accomodate working with data at an aggregated district-level as opposed to the individual student level.</li>
<li>We can accomodate the treatment being a (non-binary) ratio.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, even though <em>there is a sampling issue</em> in addition to the data not being the ideal population data we would like to have, the results can still have internal validity <em>provided</em>&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="methodological-issues">Methodological issues</h2>
<p>&hellip;<em>provided</em></p>
<p>the method used by the authors does identification and estimation properly (i.e.) method must be fat Thor enough to fight Thanos!</p>

<section data-shortcode-section>
<h2 id="d-what-are-the-treatment-and-control-groups-">d) What are the treatment and control groups? &hellip;</h2>
<p>The expectation (Thor) is:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Treated group</em>: Students who got in-person learning.</li>
<li><em>Control group</em>: Students who didn&rsquo;t get in-person learning (i.e) got virtual learning.</li>

</section><section>
<h2 id="d--how-do-the-authors-build-the-counterfactual">d) &hellip; How do the authors build the counterfactual?</h2>
<p>The reality (fat Thor) is:</p>
<p>$$\begin{align}
pass_{ict} = &\alpha + \beta_1 (\% InPerson_{it}) + \beta_2 (\% Hybrid_{it}) \\
& + \gamma_{ct} + \delta_t + \eta_i + \Pi X_{ict} + \epsilon_{ict}
\end{align}$$</p>
<p>They build a faithful counterfactual by controlling for:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>observable</em> characteristics of district-location ($\Pi X_{ict}$) and</li>
<li><em>unobservable</em> district, location and time fixed effects</li>

<h2 id="e-what-is-the-estimand-the-authors-use">e) What is the estimand the authors use?</h2>
<h3 id="prof-wanted-me-to-tell-you">Prof wanted me to tell you&hellip;</h3>
<p>Whenever you are asked this question remember that you must <em>ONLY</em> pick from this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>ATE
<ul>
<li>Local ATE (forthcoming in this course)</li>
<li>Weighted ATE (when treatment is in dosages)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ATT</li>
<li>ATC</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h3 id="how-to-reason-about-the-estimand">How to reason about the estimand</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Step 1</em>: Draw <em>that</em> table as it applies for the operationalization in the paper you are reading.</li>
<li><em>Step 2</em>: Think about in which rows we are filling in the unobserved potential outcomes (i.e) Who&rsquo;s counterfactual are we actually proxying?</li>
</ul>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally, Matching only fills $Y^0_i$ of treated units&rsquo; rows. That is why it is ATT.</li>
<li>Generally, DiD only fills $Y^0_i$ of treated units&rsquo; rows. That is why it is ATT.</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h3 id="back-to-the-question---e-what-is-the-estimand-the-authors-use">Back to the question - e) What is the estimand the authors use?</h3>
<p>Note that the treatment is in dosages (i.e) a ratio between 0 and 1.</p>
<ul>
<li>That amounts to admitting everyone has some treatment. So all are somewhat treated which means ATT (what DiD gives) $\equiv$ ATE</li>
<li>But then effects are weighted by the dosage. So it is weighted ATE.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="f-what-assumptions-are-made-by-the-identification-strategy-">f) What assumptions are made by the identification strategy? &hellip;</h2>
<ol>
<li><em>Conditional Parallel Trends Assumption (PTA)</em>: Conditionally on included controls, the pass rate in different districts would develop the same way if they had the same regime.</li>
<li><em>Backdoor is closed</em>: The schooling mode imposed on each district is not dependent on the pass rate of the students in the district.</li>

<h2 id="g-why-do-the-authors-use-different-combinations-of-fixed-effects-">g) Why do the authors use different combinations of fixed effects? &hellip;</h2>
<p>In Table 3 District Fixed Effect ($\eta_i$) is always done. It is combined with either State-year or CZ-year or county-year <em>but not all three at the same time!</em></p>
<ul>
<li>These FEs help to reduce the effects of variables that guide the pass rate in a specific county, state or CZ.
<ul>
<li>State or county political orientations and others&hellip;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="g---can-they-combine-these-effects-in-one-regression-why">g)  &hellip; Can they combine these effects in one regression? Why?</h2>
<p>Including State-year, CZ-year and county-year makes them <em>unidentifiable</em>! It is not a mere multicollinearity.</p>
<p><span class='fragment ' >Can one county straddle across two CZs? Yes!</span></p>
<p><span class='fragment ' >Can one CZ straddle across two states? Yes!</span></p>

<h2 id="h-explain-why-the-authors-present-table-2">h) Explain why the authors present Table 2.</h2>
<p>To say that treatment is not as-if random but then including FEs makes things better. A regression like:</p>
<p>$$(\% InPerson_{i,t=2020}) = \beta_1 \mathbf{Z_{ic,t=2020}} + \gamma_{c,t=2020} + \epsilon_{ic,t=2020}$$</p>

<h2 id="i-why-do-the-authors-need-the-alternative-pass-rate-cut-off-results-presented-in-table-4">i) Why do the authors need the alternative pass rate cut-off results presented in Table 4?</h2>
<ul>

<li>Then, just understand the world the authors are narrating. What is their story?</li>
